[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/fc9346c5509d4f5ca416ac69beacda44)](https://www.codacy.com/app/PartTimeLegend/Desktop-Background-Image-Deleter?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=PartTimeLegend/Desktop-Background-Image-Deleter&utm_campaign=badger)

These scripts are designed to allow the user to delete their current desktop background, and can then manually cycle to the next one. Good for those with lots of unsorted backgrounds.
<p>
<b>Installation:</b>
<ul>
<li> Place "WPTargetDir.vbs" into "C:\Windows\" (Will require elevated permissions). <br>
<li> Run add.reg to add context menu item.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Uninstallation:</b>
<ul>
<li> Delete "WPTargetDir.vbs from "C:\Windows\WPTargetDir.vbs"<br>
<li> Run undo.reg to remove context menu item.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Usage:</b><br>
<ul>
<li> Ensure you have your background set to automatically change.<br>
<li> Hold shfit and right click on the desktop (Avoid any files), and click "Delete Current Desktop Background".<br>
<li> Since Windows holds the file in memory, it will still be your background. Just right click on the desktop and click "Next Background".
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Compatability:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>This script has only been tested on Windows 7. I cannot confirm that it works on any other version of Windows.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>To do:</b><br>
<ul>

</ul>
